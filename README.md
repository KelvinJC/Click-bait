# Click-bait

<h2> A case study of digital data analytics.<h2>

<br>

Clique bait is a fictional online seafood restaurant.

In this case study - the task is to come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

<br>
Campaign analysis is almost everywhere in the data world, especially in marketing, digital, UX and retail industries - and being able to analyse views, clicks and other digital behaviour is a critical part of a data analyst's skillset.

<br>
  
Some questions I investigated include:

* Number of cookies per user on average
* Number of unique visits by all users per month
* Top 3 products by purchases
* Average conversion rate from view to cart add?
* Average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

* Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
* Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
* What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
* What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?

Included below is a single A4 infographic that the Clique bait team can use for their management reporting sessions. It emphasises the most important points from my findings.
